		<string>How do I sell my ticket?</string>
		<key>answer</key>
		<string>Selling your tickets with Dingo is easy. Either click on the Sell Tickets button at the bottom of the homescreen and search for your event or click the Sell Tickets button on the event page itself. From there, fill out the required information, add a photo of your ticket(s) and confirm your listing. All your tickets can be viewed and edited in the My Tickets section.

If you cannot find your event, fill in all the required information and we will add your tickets once verified.

We have designed Dingo to be effortlessly simple. If you think we could improve our user experience, we would love to hear from you at info@dingoapp.co.uk.</string>

		<key>question</key>
		<string>Why can’t I sell my ticket above face value?</string>
		<key>answer</key>
		<string>Dingo is a service for fans by fans. We think the secondary ticket market in the UK is a murky world rife with touts, fraud and inflated prices. Dingo aims to change the secondary market for good, starting with face value tickets and secured transactions.</string>

		<key>question</key>
		<string>How do the payments work?</string>
		<key>answer</key>
		<string>We are committed to making the secondary ticket market more transparent. Unfortunately there are people who make a lot of money selling fake tickets to unknowing fans. To protect buyers we release the money to the seller 48 hours after the event so the tickets can be verified.

Buyers have 48 hours to report any problems. After this we cannot help!</string>

		<key>question</key>
		<string>Is selling my ticket legal?</string>
		<key>answer</key>
		<string>Under UK law, two types of ticket are illegal for resale by an unauthorised individual. These are 1) UK train tickets and 2) Professional football tickets (including premier league and FA Cup competition tickets).

Although not illegal, some venues or concert promoters also ban the resale of their tickets. Where unsure we advise you to check with the event organisers.</string>
